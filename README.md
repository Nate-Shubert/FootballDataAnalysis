## Football Data Analysis Portfolio

#Summary
The purpose of this repository is to display data analysis projects I've made for potential positions as an analyist in the National Football League.

This repository contains the following projects:

1. Defensive Tendency Breakdown - 
I was lucky enough to recieve a csv file from an old position coach of mine that contained raw data from defensive film breakdown they performed on an upcoming opponent. I wrote a few functions in Python to analyze the game data and breakdown defensive tendencies for Coverage, Blitz, and Defensive Fronts.

2. Win Prediction Model and Probability - 
This project took inspiration from the books "The Hidden Game of Football" by Bob Carroll and "The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract" by Bill James. I started this project by using the Beautiful Soup Python package to web scrape 19 years of NFL Regular Season Team Data. From this data, I used pythagorean thoerem, linear regression modeling, and multiple methods of distribution to create models for predicting win percentage over the course of an NFL season.

3. Oline_Analysis - 
In this project, I took multiple Kaggle datasets related to NFL offensive line players data. The ultimiate goal was to find a way to isolate EPA contributions by individual linemen. I used the basic EPA model introduced by Bob Carroll for this. The final product is an interesting function that breakdown a linemens performance into 4 buckets in one play - Allowing a Sack, QB Hit, QB Hurry, or Clean Pocket. Having determined an average EPA value for these events, I determined the overall EPA value of each offensive linemen in the dataset.
